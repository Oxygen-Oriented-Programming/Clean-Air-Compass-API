## Summary

Clean Air Compass is a mapping interface and alert system for data from the open Purple Air network of citizen-run air quality sensors.

The pain point our site solves is that the current map provided by Purple Air only shows point location for each sensor and it would be helpful for a user to be able to access estimated air quality for their home or any other location in their area.  Additionally, the ability to access fine-grained alerts for air quality in their location allows users to make critical health safety decisions. Users with asthma or other pulmonary conditions would benefit greatly from more spatially accurate information about air quality.

## MVP

Our site will provide an interactive spatially interpolated map of air quality index data for a user specified location. The user will also have the opportunity to make an account to keep track of their favorite locations as well as sign up for alerts about air quality in their area.

## Stretch Goals

- Provide the user graphs of historical air quality data for their location.
- Create a predictive model of air quality for user location based on historical data.
